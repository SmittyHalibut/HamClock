These classes allow the ESP8266 version of HamClock to be built on Raspberry Pi or other UNIX systems to
display on the desktop as an X11 app or use the raw linux frame buffer. The latter uses /dev/fb0 for display
and the mouse device /dev/input/mice in place of the touch panel.

The approach proved to be sound as there are _very_ few changes needed to the ESP HamClock code. But note
this is not intended to be a general purpose porting layer, I only implemented the methods I happen to use
in the HamClock. The idea could be expanded further if the need arises.

The files from Adafruit and Sparkfun were edited for cosmetic purposes only, mostly to get clean
compiles on all platforms. No changes were made to functionality.
