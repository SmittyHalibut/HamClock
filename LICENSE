Note well the "Software" does not include the backend service, without which
HamClock is nearly useless. Backend service is provided free of charge to all
HamClock users unless you make money from HamClock, in which case I ask that
you pay me 10% of your retail sales. Please contact me before proceeding at
ecdowney@clearskyinstitute.com. Thank you.
