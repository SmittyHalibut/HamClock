# ESPHamClock
This is a "fork" (not in the literal `git` sense) of the great ESPHamClock by Clear Skys Institute.  They optimzed their code for the ESP8266, I'm optimizing for use on a computer instead.

The `upstream` branch is a straight copy of https://clearskyinstitute.com/ham/HamClock/ESPHamClock.tgz (first commit was v2.69, build on 2021-10-16, committed here on 2021-11-01.)  Since the original ESPHamClock isn't in GitHub, I'll occasionally pull down the original source code and commit it to `upstream` whenever I want to merge upstream changes, but I don't guarantee I'll get every version here.  For the original, please go to the original source: https://clearskyinstitute.com/ham/HamClock/

See `README` in this directory for the original ESPHamClock README.

The `main` branch is where I'll be doing my work.
